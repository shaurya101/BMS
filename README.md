The BMS successfully triggered and disconnected the battery under fault conditions (over/under voltage or current and temperature breach) and reconnected it when conditions were in safe limits again. A dashboard was also created to visually observe the same with green light signalling smooth functioning and red representing fault and BMS trigger.
