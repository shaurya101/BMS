# BMS
Battery Management System for safe operation of Li-ion NMC cell for Nissan Leaf (WLTP) and Ather 450 (MNEDC) drive cycles for charge and discharge processes.The BMS system designed was of a Korean battery manufacturer Kokam, Cell Model 'SLPB72216216'.

The BMS successfully triggered and disconnected the battery under fault conditions (over/under voltage or current and temperature breach) and reconnected it when conditions were in safe limits again. A dashboard was also created to visually observe the same with green light signalling smooth functioning and red representing fault and BMS trigger.
